# 21-day-SOC-Analyst
The "21-day-SOC-Analyst" repository is a comprehensive collection of resources, exercises, and projects designed to guide aspiring Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts through a 21-day learning journey.

Throughout this 21-day program, you will explore various topics, including incident response, threat intelligence, log analysis, network monitoring, and more. Each day, you'll find carefully curated learning materials, exercises, and practical challenges to reinforce your understanding and apply the concepts learned. By the end of the program, you should have a solid foundation in SOC analysis and be well-equipped to tackle real-world security incidents.
